# **QwenVL for ComfyUI (Fork)**

This is a fork of [1038lab/ComfyUI-QwenVL](https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-QwenVL) with the following additions:

## **Fork Changes**

- **Local-only model discovery (no automatic downloading)**: Every download path has been removed from all six nodes — no `snapshot_download`, no `hf_hub_download`, no background download threads. Model dropdowns are built purely by scanning your disk, so you place models yourself and reload ComfyUI. If a model is missing, the node raises an error listing the folders it looked in instead of starting a download.
  - **Scanned folders**: `ComfyUI/models/text_encoders` and `ComfyUI/models/LLM` by default, both scanned recursively (subfolders included). Configurable via `base_dirs` in `hf_models.json` / `gguf_models.json`; entries can be a `folder_paths` key (so `extra_model_paths.yaml` roots are picked up — `text_encoders` is one of ComfyUI's own), a `ComfyUI/models` subfolder, or an absolute path. Folders are scanned in order and the first match wins on a name clash.
  - **What gets listed**: HF checkpoints are directories holding a `config.json` next to weight shards — the QwenVL nodes list only vision checkpoints (detected from `config.json`), while the Prompt Enhancer lists all of them and picks the text-only or VL code path automatically. GGUF nodes list every `.gguf` by its path relative to its root.
  - **Backward compatible**: model names saved in older workflows (including the `[local] relative/path` form) still resolve.
  - The model entries in `hf_models.json` / `gguf_models.json` are no longer read; they remain only as a reference list of where to download models from by hand.
- **Explicit mmproj selection**: GGUF Advanced nodes gained an `mmproj_name` widget listing every `*mmproj*.gguf` found on disk. The default `auto` keeps the previous behaviour of picking the projector sitting next to the chosen model.
- **Context length control for the GGUF Prompt Enhancer**: a `ctx` widget (default 8192) replaces the context length that used to come from the catalog.
- **Multiple image reference support**: Advanced nodes (HF / GGUF) accept up to 3 image inputs (`image`, `image2`, `image3`) for simultaneous multi-image analysis.
- **Thinking mode toggle**: `enable_thinking` switch on all nodes (Simple / Advanced, HF / GGUF). Enables the `<think>...</think>` reasoning mode for Qwen3-VL Thinking models; disabled by default.
- **Gemma 4 GGUF support**: GGUF nodes auto-detect Gemma models by filename and switch to `Gemma4ChatHandler`, bypass the Qwen-specific `/think` prefix injection and MROPE image-resize guard, and strip Gemma's `<|channel|>` reasoning markers from the output. Requires the [JamePeng fork of llama-cpp-python v0.3.35+](https://github.com/JamePeng/llama-cpp-python/discussions/109). Qwen models continue to work unchanged.

## **📖 Usage**

### **Basic Usage**

1. Add the **"QwenVL"** node from the 🧪AILab/QwenVL category.  
2. Select the **model\_name** you wish to use.  
3. Connect an image or video (image sequence) source to the node.  
4. Write your prompt using the preset or custom field.  
5. Run the workflow.

### **Advanced Usage**

For more control, use the **"QwenVL (Advanced)"** node. This gives you access to detailed generation parameters like temperature, top\_p, beam search, and device selection.

## **⚙️ Parameters**

| Parameter | Description | Default | Range | Node(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **model\_name** | The Qwen-VL model to use. | Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct | \- | Standard & Advanced |
| **quantization** | On-the-fly quantization. Ignored for pre-quantized models (e.g., FP8). | 8-bit (Balanced) | 4-bit, 8-bit, None | Standard & Advanced |
| **attention\_mode** | Attention mechanism: auto (Sage→Flash→SDPA), sage, flash\_attention\_2, sdpa | auto | auto, sage, flash\_attention\_2, sdpa | Standard & Advanced |
| **preset\_prompt** | A selection of pre-defined prompts for common tasks. | "Describe this..." | Any text | Standard & Advanced |
| **custom\_prompt** | Overrides the preset prompt if provided. |  | Any text | Standard & Advanced |
| **max\_tokens** | Maximum number of new tokens to generate. | 1024 | 64-2048 | Standard & Advanced |
| **keep\_model\_loaded** | Keep the model in VRAM for faster subsequent runs. | True | True/False | Standard & Advanced |
| **seed** | A seed for reproducible results. | 1 | 1 \- 2^64-1 | Standard & Advanced |
| **temperature** | Controls randomness. Higher values \= more creative. (Used when num\_beams is 1). | 0.6 | 0.1-1.0 | Advanced Only |
| **top\_p** | Nucleus sampling threshold. (Used when num\_beams is 1). | 0.9 | 0.0-1.0 | Advanced Only |
| **num\_beams** | Number of beams for beam search. \> 1 disables temperature/top\_p sampling. | 1 | 1-10 | Advanced Only |
| **repetition\_penalty** | Discourages repeating tokens. | 1.2 | 0.0-2.0 | Advanced Only |
| **frame\_count** | Number of frames to sample from the video input. | 16 | 1-64 | Advanced Only |

### **💡 Quantization Options**

| Mode | Precision | Memory Usage | Speed | Quality | Recommended For |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| None (FP16) | 16-bit Float | High | Fastest | Best | High VRAM GPUs (16GB+) |
| 8-bit (Balanced) | 8-bit Integer | Medium | Fast | Very Good | Balanced performance (8GB+) |
| 4-bit (VRAM-friendly) | 4-bit Integer | Low | Slower\* | Good | Low VRAM GPUs (<8GB) |

\* **Note on 4-bit Speed**: 4-bit quantization significantly reduces VRAM usage but may result in slower performance on some systems due to the computational overhead of real-time dequantization.

### **🎯 Attention Mode Guide**

| Mode | Description | Best For |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **auto** | Automatically selects best available: Sage → Flash → SDPA | Most users (recommended) |
| **sage** | SageAttention with GPU-optimized kernels | Speed on modern GPUs (RTX 40 series, Hopper, Blackwell) |
| **flash\_attention\_2** | Flash Attention 2 | Speed when Sage unavailable |
| **sdpa** | PyTorch SDPA (default) | Compatibility, FP8/BitsAndBytes models |

**Note**: FP8 models and BitsAndBytes quantization automatically use SDPA regardless of selection.

### **🤔 Setting Tips**

| Setting | Recommendation |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Model Choice** | For most users, Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct is a great starting point. If you have a 40-series GPU, try the \-FP8 version for better performance. |
| **Memory Mode** | Keep keep\_model\_loaded enabled (True) for the best performance if you plan to run the node multiple times. Disable it only if you are running out of VRAM for other nodes. |
| **Quantization** | Start with the default 8-bit. If you have plenty of VRAM (>16GB), switch to None (FP16) for the best speed and quality. If you are low on VRAM, use 4-bit. |
| **Attention Mode** | Use "auto" for best performance. SageAttention provides fastest inference on supported GPUs. |
| **Performance** | The first time a model is loaded with a specific quantization, it may be slow. Subsequent runs (with keep\_model\_loaded enabled) will be much faster. |
